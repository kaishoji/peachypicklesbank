        Hello! This project is an extra curricular one, taken under by Kai and Ellesse. We were
        looking at a list project ideas to do, and couldn't just pick one. So! The best next
        option was to combine the top three we had trouble deciding on, which was building a 
        website, creating a banking app, as well as building a currency converter. We hope you
        enjoy the fruits of our labor, and if you do, don't forget to check out the GitHub pages
        linked below!
